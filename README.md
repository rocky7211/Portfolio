# Portfolio Website - GH-Pages Branch Overview

Welcome to the `gh-pages` branch of the portfolio website repository. This branch is a special branch used to host and publish the static content of the portfolio website directly on GitHub Pages. It serves as the live, public-facing version of the portfolio, showcasing projects, skills, and professional information.

## Purpose

The `gh-pages` branch is dedicated to:

- **Hosting the Portfolio Website:** This branch contains the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) necessary for the portfolio website. It is automatically served by GitHub Pages at a unique URL.
- **Simplifying Deployment:** Changes pushed to this branch are automatically deployed to the web, making updates and new content go live without manual deployment steps.
- **Version Control for Website Content:** Leveraging Git's version control capabilities, this branch helps track changes, manage updates, and maintain a history of the website's evolution.

## Workflow

1. **Development:** All development work, including new features and bug fixes, is done in separate branches based on the project's workflow.
2. **Testing:** Changes are thoroughly tested in a development or staging environment to ensure they work as expected.
3. **Merging:** Once changes are tested and reviewed, they are merged into the `gh-pages` branch.
