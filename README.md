## Update! (03/03/23)

Removing .NET as a core technology for this project. ReactJS is sufficient to complete everything that is required.

The main project that will eventually be deployed is portfolio, there are a number of things left to do on this project.

Commit a7d7f15 replaced vscode dependancies and such .NET also. 
The commit also committed the new projects. There are a number of things to do for portfolio.

Completed:
- ReactDOM Routing has been completed, to enable multiple pages on the one app.

To Do:

**Objective:** The aim for this document is to outline a detailed plan for the design, construction and deployment of 
Portfolio 2.0 website. It will set out requirement and ideas, alongside analysis on what is required to implement each 
step. This document is the rule of law, everything in this document is to be consider like law and applied directly into
the project in one way or another. This document is the MVP law book, everything we need to ensure the project reaches
MVP as defined in another section. Once we have ticked the definition of done at the end, then only then can we work
away from this document. It is designed to ensure we reach the definition of done and have something amazing to show 
prospective employers. 

**Scope:** Design, Planning, Construction, Deployment ~~and Maintenance~~ of Portfolio 2.0 project. Overlooks the entire 
process for building Project Portfolio 2.0 and is the law from start to the definition of done. Maintenance will not be
covered in this document, due to the nature of the project. Once deployed, the website will not need further work.
Only exception is adding new projects to the website, see the related section for more.

## Design
Designing of this project has taken place on different mediums, such as whiteboards and FreeForm App. These will be
included in the project folder, not within this document. Refer to these designs for any visual UI work that is done on
the project. Designs are allowed to change but must stick to the overall theme, feel, and expectations.

## Plan

So far there is a detailed visual design, that envisions how the website should look as a minimal viable production (MVP).
These will not be explored here in this document, however it is worth mentioning that any design decisions should be 
referred to these initials designs. These are found at current on the FreeForm app on Apple devices.
