# Portfolio (PROD)
A new and improved Portfolio (2.0) built on ReactJS

The gh-pages branch contains the final production build of the react app, which is hosted on the website.

If you would like to see the development branch, please see main.

## Know issues
- Issue 21, where new production builds using gh-pages causes the custom domain to be removed.
  This means that for any new production builds that are published, the site is unpublished from jaredmcdowall.me causing a 404.
  Currently, the custom domain needs to be readded as a workaround, until this issue is fixed.
